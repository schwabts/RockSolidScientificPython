    "\n",
    "## Twelve (baby) steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Use version control](https://www.davidketcheson.info/2015/05/11/use_version_control.html)\n",
    "1. [Put your code in the cloud, in the open](https://www.davidketcheson.info/2015/05/12/code_in_the_open.html)\n",
    "1. [Add a README and a License](https://www.davidketcheson.info/2015/05/13/add_a_readme.html)\n",
    "1. [Write docstrings](https://www.davidketcheson.info/2015/05/14/write_docstrings.html)\n",
    "1. [Write tests](https://www.davidketcheson.info/2015/05/15/write_tests.html)\n",
    "1. [Keep track of issues](https://www.davidketcheson.info/2015/05/16/track_issues.html)\n",
    "1. [Automate the tests](https://www.davidketcheson.info/2015/05/29/automate_tests.html)\n",
    "1. Automate the build (coming soon)\n",
    "1. Use continuous integration (coming soon)\n",
    "1. Monitor test coverage (coming soon)\n",
    "1. Write narrative documentation (coming soon)\n",
    "1. Catch errors as you type them (coming soon)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1 - Use version control\n",
    "\n",
    "State-of-the-art is **git**, documented in the [Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).\n",
    "If you don’t have it, get it here: [http://git-scm.com/downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads).\n",
    "Then take a moment to [set up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#setting-up-git).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2 - Code in the open\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Share your code on [Github](https://github.com/) where you should already have an account.\n",
    "1. Once you’re logged in, click on the “+” in the upper-right part of the screen and select “New repository”.\n",
    "1. Give it the same name as your project, and write a short description.\n",
    "1. Don’t initialize it with a README or license file (we’ll do that in Step #3).\n",
    "1. Preferably, select “public” repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3 - Add a README and a License\n",
    "\n",
    "### You need a README file\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a minimalist documentation – just what is absolutely necessary for someone to start using your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to your project directory and open a new file. Call it README.md. The .md extension stands for Markdown, which is just an embellished format for text files that lets you add text formatting in simple ways that will automatically show up on Github. You can learn more about Markdown here, but for the moment just think of it as a text file.\n",
    "1. Write the contents of the README file. You should probably include:\n",
    "    * a brief description of what your code does;\n",
    "    * instructions for installing your code;\n",
    "    * what other code needs to be installed for it to work;\n",
    "    * one or two examples of how to invoke your code;\n",
    "    * optionally: who wrote the code, how to cite it, and who to contact for help. One good example of a README file is [here](https://github.com/github/markup/blob/master/README.md).\n",
    "1. Save and close the file.\n",
    "1. Add it to your repository with git add and git commit.\n",
    "1. Push the file to github with git push.\n",
    "1. Go to the page for your project on Github. You should see the contents of your README file displayed automatically right below the directory listing. It should look something like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### You need a License file\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common licenses for open source scientific software are\n",
    "\n",
    "* [BSD](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-2-clause/),\n",
    "* [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), and\n",
    "* [GPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-2.0/).\n",
    "\n",
    "My suggestion is to use a BSD license, but if you want to investigate in more detail, try [Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com/) or go read [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406002/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file called LICENSE.txt in your project directory.\n",
    "1. Paste the license text (from one of the links above) into the file, save, and close.\n",
    "1. Commit and push the file to Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4 - write docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 1-3 were language-agnostic, but now I’m going to assume you’re using Python. The Python language has a built-in feature for documenting functions, classes, and modules; it is the docstring. A docstring for a very simple function looks like this:"
